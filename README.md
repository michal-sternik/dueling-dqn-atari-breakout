Project focuses on training a **Dueling Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** agent to play Atari's Breakout (and others) game. The agent utilizes a replay memory buffer for sampling past experiences and implements an epsilon decay strategy for balancing exploration and exploitation during training. It employs max-pooling mechanism to process visual input and stabilize learning. The model architecture was based on </br> [Ziyu Wang, Tom Schaul, Matteo Hessel, Hado van Hasselt, Marc Lanctot, Nando de Freitas. “Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning” 2016] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06581. 
</br> The project includes both training and testing pipelines, and the results are placed below in form of mp4 videos. You can download pre-trained models.
